Build steps for SPC:
   - The package is dependent on the following external packages that should
     be installed on your system:
       - xmllib2
       - tclap
       - net user space library

   - Set environment variables or modify Makefile with the following entries:
       - NET_USPACE_HEADER_PATH - path to net user space package headers location
       - LIBXML2_HEADER_PATH    - path to libxml2 include files
       - TCLAP_HEADER_PATH      - path to TCLAP include files

   - Issue 'make' command
   
   - For host side compilation (the mode in which SPC doesn't use
     direct libfm API calls), use 'make FMCHOSTMODE=1' command

Install steps for SPC:
   - After successful compilation, put 'spc' application to
     /usr/bin folder of your target
   - Copy 'etc' folder to /etc folder of your target

Install verification:
    spc --help
    command should provide list of command line options available

    spc -s sample.xml
    command will produce an example soft parser configuration source code
